An unforgettable midnight snack</h3><br><p>Every night, Noh Da Hyun is tormented by nightmares of her stalker, and it’s common for her to wake up in a terrified sweat. Eun Gye Hoon is the same. One night, they both turn to drinking to lull them to sleep, and they end up crossing paths. Using the need for food as an excuse, they share a late-night snack together.</p><br><p>Noh Da Hyun was unable to take her eyes off of Eun Gye Hoon’s cooking performance, and his culinary creation helped dispel her dismal mood. Viewers could get a sense of how her feelings were changing as she ran toward the lit-up restaurant with a smile.</p><br><h3>2. The heart-pounding umbrella scene</h3><br><p>Unable to let go of the hope that Noh Da Hyun might be his sister who went missing 18 years ago, Eun Gye Hoon took care of her through more ways than just cooking. In episode 3, Noh Da Hyun was about to run through the rain with a bag over her head when Eun Gye Hoon appeared with an umbrella, turning the scene into a beautiful work of art.</p><br><p>Having no choice but to share one umbrella after the second one broke, the pair seemed to be a likely couple. Even though his shoulder was getting wet, he made sure to hold the umbrella fully over Noh Da Hyun’s head, proving his well-mannered nature towards her. Meanwhile, Noh Da Hyun peeked over at him with wavering eyes, revealing her emotional state. Furthermore, when Eun Gye Hoon started to ask, “Do you maybe…?” she retorted, “I’m not falling for you, I don’t like you. Happy?” Their small exchange of words was enough to make viewers’ hearts beat with excitement.</p><br><p><img alt=\"\" class=\"lazyload alignnone size-full wp-image-1532883\" src=\"https://0.soompi.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/26011510/Yeo-Jin-Goo-Moon-Ga-Young-11.jpg\" srcset=\"https://0.soompi.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/26011510/Yeo-Jin-Goo-Moon-Ga-Young-11.jpg 700w, https://0.soompi.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/26011510/Yeo-Jin-Goo-Moon-Ga-Young-11-300x239.jpg 300w, https://0.soompi.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/26011510/Yeo-Jin-Goo-Moon-Ga-Young-11-540x430.jpg 540w\" height=\"557\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" width=\"700\"/></p><br><h3>3. The emotion-sharing experiment</h3><br><p>When Noh Da Hyun found out that Eun Gye Hoon could feel her emotions, she thought he was playing a childish trick on her and teased, “Then try to figure out what I’m feeling.” After they made eye contact, her wildly beating heart was immediately felt by Eun Gye Hoon.</p><br><p>Viewers were touched by the situation due to Eun Gye Hoon’s knowledge of her feelings and the distance he was trying to put between them, as well as Noh Da Hyun’s watery eyes as her feelings grew stronger. The pair are growing closer step by step, and it remains to be seen if their true feelings will be revealed.</p><br><p><img alt=\"\" class=\"lazyload alignnone size-full wp-image-1532882\" src=\"https://0.soompi.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/26011450/Yeo-Jin-Goo-Moon-Ga-Young-21.jpg\" srcset=\"https://0.soompi.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/26011450/Yeo-Jin-Goo-Moon-Ga-Young-21.jpg 700w, https://0.soompi.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/26011450/Yeo-Jin-Goo-Moon-Ga-Young-21-300x118.jpg 300w, https://0.soompi.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/26011450/Yeo-Jin-Goo-Moon-Ga-Young-21-540x213.jpg 540w\" height=\"276\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" width=\"700\"/></p><br><p>“Link” airs every Monday and Tuesday at 10:30 p.m. KST.</p>\n",

A lineup of unique characters</h3><br><p>The drama will include characters such as Nam Han Joon, a narcissistic shaman with a unique fashion sense, and Han Jae Hee, who is skilled in the art of both investigation and action-packed showdowns. Joining the lineup are also the barista Gong Soo Chul and the legendary hacker Nam Hye Joon, as well as the prosecutor Cha Do Won (<a href=\"https://www.viki.com/celebrities/22058pr-kwon-soo-hyun?utm_source=soompi&amp;utm_medium=soompi_news&amp;utm_campaign=soompi_link&amp;utm_content=3-reasons-to-tune-in-to-new-comedy-mystery-drama-cafe-minamdang&amp;utm_content_id=1532862wpp\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.viki.com']);\" target=\"_blank\">Kwon Soo Hyun</a>).</p><br><p>Scriptwriter Park Hye Jin commented, “While writing ‘Café Minamdang,’ I paid the most attention to the characters.

An unpredictable rivalry</h3><br><p>Another key point of interest will the the conflict between the staff of the fortune-telling house Minamdang, who don’t shy away from rule-breaking and unconventional methods, and the law-abiding violent crimes squad. Nam Han Joon’s history as a profiler as well as Nam Hye Joon’s past in the National Intelligence Service will aid them in their quest to satisfy the needs of their customers, albeit in unexpected ways.</p><br><p>A rivalry will also come to light when they have a run-in with detective Han Jae Hee, who never steps out of line.

He shared his thoughts on learning Korean and how the language is so rich with expressions. “Sometimes when I speak in English, I know the word in Korean but I can’t think of the word in English,” he confessed. “I want to express this word in English, but there’s no exact way to express it. So when I’m talking with my friends sometimes I just shout out, ‘What is that word!'”</p><br><p>As for what he has been up to the past few months, Mark answered that he spent much of his time doing photo shoots and preparing for GOT7’s comeback. Although rumors had spread that they would be breaking up after <a href=\"https://www.soompi.com/article/1448107wpp/jyp-entertainment-announces-got7s-departure-from-agency\" target=\"_blank\">leaving</a> JYP Entertainment last year, Mark said with assurance that they had no intentions of going their separate ways.</p><br><p>He continued, “After leaving the company, we decided to do what we wanted to do for a year and then regroup. So Yugyeom and BamBam released albums and Jinyoung did some acting. We did everything we wanted to for one year without holding back.”</p><br><p><img alt=\"\" class=\"lazyload alignnone size-full wp-image-1532861\" src=\"https://0.soompi.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/25221915/Mark-3.jpg\" srcset=\"https://0.soompi.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/25221915/Mark-3.jpg 740w, https://0.soompi.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/25221915/Mark-3-300x405.jpg 300w, https://0.soompi.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/25221915/Mark-3-540x730.jpg 540w, https://0.soompi.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/25221915/Mark-3-666x900.jpg 666w\" height=\"1000\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" width=\"740\"/></p><br><p>With the members in different countries, the time zones lead to some trouble for Mark, who was the only one in a time zone that was hours apart from the others. “After waking up, I’d have hundreds of messages,” he revealed with a laugh. “We tried to discuss things together when we were all awake.”</p><br><p>Despite being the last to see a lot of messages, Mark said that the members always waited for him to share his opinions. He said, “Since we were all spread out, there were times where the members in Korea would have meetings together. However, they would share the content of those meetings through messages and get our approval. We usually reach a decision when four of us agree. Since there’s seven of us, we decided that if four of us agree then we shouldn’t complain. I also didn’t have any complaints with that.”</p><br><p>Even so, there were times when all the members came to unanimous decisions. As an example, Mark revealed, “Our logo. Also, the title track for our album was decided in one go, just like that!”</p><br><p>GOT7’s new album came one year and six months after their last physical album. The group went for a simple green cover embellished with their group name, which Mark said was to show that ‘this album is us.’ He added, “This is the music we want to do and we’re going to keep doing it as seven members.”</p><br><p>If you haven’t already, check out GOT7’s music video for “<a href=\"https://www.soompi.com/article/1527608wpp/watch-got7-serenades-with-nanana-in-suave-comeback-mv\" target=\"_blank\">NANANA</a>” here!</p><br><p><img alt=\"\" class=\"lazyload alignnone size-full wp-image-1532859\" src=\"https://0.soompi.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/25221842/Mark.jpg\" srcset=\"https://0.soompi.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/25221842/Mark.jpg 740w, https://0.soompi.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/25221842/Mark-300x405.jpg 300w, https://0.soompi.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/25221842/Mark-540x730.jpg 540w, https://0.soompi.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/25221842/Mark-666x900.jpg 666w\" height=\"1000\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" width=\"740\"/></p>\n",

Yoo Ji Tae stars as the Professor, the mastermind behind the operation, while his star-studded crew of robbers includes Park Hae Soo (who goes by the name “Berlin”) and Jeon Jong Seo (known as “Tokyo”).<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p><br><p>Describing one of the biggest differences between the original series and the Korean remake, Yoo Ji Tae explained, “Two seasons’ worth of plot from the original version were condensed into just 12 episodes [for our remake]. There’s no exposition for exposition’s sake, and we only deliver the key plot points as necessary. There’s a certain pleasure that comes from the fast-paced plot development.”</p><br><p>As for how he prepared for his role, Yoo Ji Tae shared, “In this condensed version, I came to the conclusion that one way I could quickly show the Professor’s charms in one go was through his voice. After giving it lots of thought, I began developing the Professor’s voice while turning to narrations or animated dialogue for reference.”</p><br><p><img alt=\"\" class=\"lazyload alignnone size-full wp-image-1532838\" src=\"https://0.soompi.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/25190832/Yoo-Ji-Tae.jpg\" srcset=\"https://0.soompi.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/25190832/Yoo-Ji-Tae.jpg 1125w, https://0.soompi.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/25190832/Yoo-Ji-Tae-300x374.jpg 300w, https://0.soompi.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/25190832/Yoo-Ji-Tae-768x958.jpg 768w, https://0.soompi.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/25190832/Yoo-Ji-Tae-540x674.jpg 540w, https://0.soompi.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/25190832/Yoo-Ji-Tae-721x900.jpg 721w\" height=\"1404\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1125px) 100vw, 1125px\" width=\"1125\"/></p><br><p>Meanwhile, Park Hae Soo confessed that there had been a certain amount of pressure that came with remaking such a popular show.</p><br><p>“Of course there were concerns and pressure due to the fact that the original series received such a great response,” said the actor. “But while reading the script, I could clearly see the differences that were unique to ‘Money Heist: Korea – Joint Economic Area.’ There was a fast pace to the story, and the characters definitively gave the Korean version its own strength.”</p><br><p>Park Hae Soo added, “Although Berlin is a fictional character, you could see him as a sort of metaphor for the situation between North Korea and South Korea, which makes his story even more forlorn.”</p><br><p><img alt=\"\" class=\"lazyload alignnone size-full wp-image-1532837\" src=\"https://0.soompi.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/25190550/Park-Hae-Soo.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://0.soompi.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/25190550/Park-Hae-Soo.jpeg 1125w, https://0.soompi.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/25190550/Park-Hae-Soo-300x374.jpeg 300w, https://0.soompi.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/25190550/Park-Hae-Soo-768x958.jpeg 768w, https://0.soompi.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/25190550/Park-Hae-Soo-540x674.jpeg 540w, https://0.soompi.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/25190550/Park-Hae-Soo-721x900.jpeg 721w\" height=\"1404\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1125px) 100vw, 1125px\" width=\"1125\"/></p><br><p>Finally, Jeon Jong Seo shared her thoughts on the strengths of their new remake.</p><br><p>“[The drama] does a great job portraying the near future,” she remarked. “The North Korea-South Korea situation adds an element of tension and suspense, and it also bears the meaning of unity. This two-sided situation completely fills up the background setting of the Mint.”</p><br><p>The actress also noted that viewers may be surprised by her version of the Tokyo character, commenting, “I think viewers will [go into the show] imagining the free-spirited charms and vibe of Tokyo from the original version. But the Tokyo in our remake is calmer, and she’s someone who steps up and tries to resolve the situation. I tried to maintain a cleaner and more aloof tone [for our version of Tokyo]. You can look forward to seeing a new side of Jeon Jong Seo.”</p><br><p>“Money Heist: Korea – Joint Economic Area” premiered on Netflix on June 24.

Not only did Geum Seok Young’’sbrother tragically pass away, but Han Yi Han also lost everything: his license to practice medicine, his lover, his happiness, and his dreams for the future.</p><br><p>Five years later, Han Yi Han made a return as a medical malpractice lawyer and vowed revenge against Goo Jin Ki. After teaming up with Jayden Lee (Shin Sung Rok), Han Yi Han was able to get his medical license reinstated, and at the end of the previous episode, he shocked everyone by suddenly taking a knife to Goo Jin Ki’s throat.</p><br><p>Although it seemed like Jayden Lee and Han Yi Han were on the same boat, the preview for episode 8 showed that Jayden Lee wasn’t the type of person who prioritized loyalty. When Goo Jin Ki asked him, “Didn’t you join hands with Han Yi Han?” Jayden Lee replied, “I don’t have any loyalties to Han Yi Han.”</p><br><p>With viewers wondering if Jayden Lee will betray Han Yi Han, the drama unveiled new photos featuring Jayden Lee, Han Yi Han, and Goo Jin Ki. In one photo, Han Yi Han is staring at someone with doubtful eyes. However, another still depicts Jayden Lee having a private meeting with Goo Jin Ki who seems to have a lot on his mind. Will Jayden Lee remain by Han Yi Han’s side, or will he join forces with Goo Jin Ki?</p><br><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"lazyload alignnone wp-image-1532775 size-full\" src=\"https://0.soompi.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/24233003/So-Ji-Sub3.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://0.soompi.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/24233003/So-Ji-Sub3.jpeg 1800w, https://0.soompi.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/24233003/So-Ji-Sub3-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://0.soompi.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/24233003/So-Ji-Sub3-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://0.soompi.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/24233003/So-Ji-Sub3-540x360.jpeg 540w, https://0.soompi.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/24233003/So-Ji-Sub3-800x533.jpeg 800w\" height=\"1200\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1800px) 100vw, 1800px\" width=\"1800\"/></p><br><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"lazyload alignnone wp-image-1532774 size-full\" src=\"https://0.soompi.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/24232941/Shin-Sung-Rok-Lee-Kyung-Young.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://0.soompi.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/24232941/Shin-Sung-Rok-Lee-Kyung-Young.jpeg 1800w, https://0.soompi.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/24232941/Shin-Sung-Rok-Lee-Kyung-Young-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://0.soompi.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/24232941/Shin-Sung-Rok-Lee-Kyung-Young-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://0.soompi.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/24232941/Shin-Sung-Rok-Lee-Kyung-Young-540x360.jpeg 540w, https://0.soompi.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/24232941/Shin-Sung-Rok-Lee-Kyung-Young-800x533.jpeg 800w\" height=\"1200\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1800px) 100vw, 1800px\" width=\"1800\"/></p><br><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"lazyload alignnone wp-image-1532773 size-full\" src=\"https://0.soompi.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/24232923/Lee-Kyung-Young.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://0.soompi.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/24232923/Lee-Kyung-Young.jpeg 1800w, https://0.soompi.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/24232923/Lee-Kyung-Young-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://0.soompi.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/24232923/Lee-Kyung-Young-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://0.soompi.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/24232923/Lee-Kyung-Young-540x360.jpeg 540w, https://0.soompi.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/24232923/Lee-Kyung-Young-800x533.jpeg 800w\" height=\"1200\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1800px) 100vw, 1800px\" width=\"1800\"/></p><br><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The next episode of “Doctor Lawyer” will air on June 25 at 9:50 p.m. KST.</p>\n",

It gives hope and a different meaning to the word “destined.” Here are eight K-dramas that explore this theme!</p><br><h3>1. “<a href=\"https://www.viki.com/tv/37087c-when-my-love-blooms?utm_source=soompi&amp;utm_medium=soompi_news&amp;utm_campaign=soompi_link&amp;utm_content=meant-to-be-8-k-dramas-with-the-theme-of-reunited-lovers&amp;utm_content_id=1530653wpp\" onclick=\"javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.viki.com']);\" target=\"_blank\">When My Love Blooms</a>”</h3><br><p><img alt=\"\" class=\"lazyload alignnone size-full wp-image-1531127\" src=\"https://0.soompi.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/15154513/when-my-love-blooms.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://0.soompi.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/15154513/when-my-love-blooms.jpeg 3000w, https://0.soompi.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/15154513/when-my-love-blooms-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://0.soompi.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/15154513/when-my-love-blooms-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://0.soompi.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/15154513/when-my-love-blooms-540x360.jpeg 540w, https://0.soompi.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/15154513/when-my-love-blooms-800x533.jpeg 800w\" height=\"2000\" sizes=\"(max-width: 3000px) 100vw, 3000px\" width=\"3000\"/></p><br><p>It’s love at first sight when Yoon Ji Soo (<a href=\"https://www.viki.com/celebrities/22181pr-jeon-so-nee?utm_source=soompi&amp;utm_medium=soompi_news&amp;utm_campaign=soompi_link&amp;utm_content=meant-to-be-8-k-dramas-with-the-theme-of-reunited-lovers&amp;utm_content_id=1530653wpp\" target=\"_blank\">Jeon So Nee</a>) first meets Han Jae Hyun (<a href=\"https://www.viki.com/celebrities/22270pr-got7?utm_source=soompi&amp;utm_medium=soompi_news&amp;utm_campaign=soompi_link&amp;utm_content=meant-to-be-8-k-dramas-with-the-theme-of-reunited-lovers&amp;utm_content_id=1530653wpp\" target=\"_blank\">GOT7</a>‘s <a href=\"https://www.viki.com/celebrities/15547pr-jinyoung-got7?utm_source=soompi&amp;utm_medium=soompi_news&amp;utm_campaign=soompi_link&amp;utm_content=meant-to-be-8-k-dramas-with-the-theme-of-reunited-lovers&amp;utm_content_id=1530653wpp\" target=\"_blank\">Jinyoung</a>).

She explained, “Due to the the confidence and high self-esteem that I’ve shown on broadcasts [throughout my career], I think I’ve struggled to talk about my concerns as a human, no matter where I go. As I’m a celebrity and a member of KARA, I often think that I can’t talk about my faults in case it causes an inconvenience to the groups I belong to.”</p><br><p><img alt=\"\" class=\"lazyload alignnone size-full wp-image-1532711\" src=\"https://0.soompi.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/24113350/Park-Gyuri-4.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://0.soompi.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/24113350/Park-Gyuri-4.jpeg 540w, https://0.soompi.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/24113350/Park-Gyuri-4-300x506.jpeg 300w, https://0.soompi.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/24113350/Park-Gyuri-4-533x900.jpeg 533w\" height=\"911\" sizes=\"(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px\" width=\"540\"/></p><br><p>Since Park Gyuri has been in the industry for a long time after debuting as a child actress, she explained that she always felt pressured to not make mistakes. This pressure made her only want to showcase a bright image, but that eventually had a negative impact on her mental health.</p><br><p>The star elaborated on her tendency to keep to herself, out of fear that those around her will leave if they know how she truly feels or if she showcases an image that is anything less than perfect. Dr. Oh Eun Young explained this as a phobia of comfort, because while Park Gyuri wants to be honest and feel comforted, she chooses to stay silent in case her honesty becomes a weakness.</p><br><p><img alt=\"\" class=\"lazyload alignnone size-full wp-image-1532710\" src=\"https://0.soompi.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/24113333/Park-Gyuri-3.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://0.soompi.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/24113333/Park-Gyuri-3.jpeg 540w, https://0.soompi.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/24113333/Park-Gyuri-3-300x338.jpeg 300w\" height=\"608\" sizes=\"(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px\" width=\"540\"/></p><br><p>Park Gyuri revealed, “Over the past two to three years, there have been a lot of difficult situations. My emotions blew up at the end of last year. At the start of this year, I went to Gangneung for about a month and cut off contact with everyone. I went alone and voluntarily chose isolation. But that felt more comfortable.”</p><br><p>Hearing this made Dr. Oh Eun Young comment, “Completely isolating yourself means you’ve lost all affection for humans.” Park Gyuri responded, “I’ve lost my love for humanity. It wasn’t one thing [that caused this]. A lot of different situations occurred and overlapped with one another and I think my energy reached rock bottom. I thought, ‘I can’t handle this anymore.'”</p><br><p>Park Gyuri touched on the numerous happenings over the past few years that affected her mental health, such as her first time publicly dating since her debut. In late 2019, Park Gyuri <a href=\"https://www.soompi.com/article/1356076wpp/former-kara-member-park-gyuri-confirmed-to-be-in-relationship-with-non-celebrity\" target=\"_blank\">confirmed</a> that she was in a relationship with a non-celebrity, who was revealed to be Song Ja Ho, an art curator and the eldest grandson of the Dongwon Construction Industry family. The pair eventually <a href=\"https://www.soompi.com/article/1488072wpp/former-kara-member-park-gyuri-confirmed-to-have-broken-up-with-boyfriend-song-ja-ho\" target=\"_blank\">broke up</a> almost two years later.</p><br><p>She revealed, “I’ve always dated cautiously so once this dating news was out, I think I experienced a lot of change as a person. Since he’s someone I chose to date, I don’t really want to mention him.” Park Gyuri shared that articles, mostly of negative nature, continued to come out after their break up. Since Park Gyuri was the public figure within their relationship, she was tied to all his matters even though they had nothing to do with her.</p><br><p>She explained the toll this had on her, saying, “Even if I was staying still, I was getting hate. Since I’m human too, I’d look at comments and wonder, ‘Why do they have to speak so negatively [about me]?’ Certain moments made me feel like it was my fault.” Park Gyuri explained that she began to blame herself for this situation, in addition to other unfortunate happenings, such as the bankruptcy of her then-agency DSP Media.</p><br><p><img alt=\"\" class=\"lazyload alignnone size-full wp-image-1532709\" src=\"https://0.soompi.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/24113317/Park-Gyuri-2.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://0.soompi.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/24113317/Park-Gyuri-2.jpeg 550w, https://0.soompi.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/24113317/Park-Gyuri-2-300x493.jpeg 300w, https://0.soompi.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/24113317/Park-Gyuri-2-540x887.jpeg 540w, https://0.soompi.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/24113317/Park-Gyuri-2-548x900.jpeg 548w\" height=\"903\" sizes=\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\" width=\"550\"/></p><br><p>Park Gyuri dissected this feeling of guilt by explaining the beginnings of her career as a child actress. Park Gyuri comes from a family of entertainers, with her mother most notably being a voice actress. She revealed, “When I was a child actress, I didn’t have a professional agency and my mom was basically my manager. My dad often said, ‘You’re nothing without your mom.'”</p><br><p>She continued, “Since I know my mother’s sacrifice, I wanted to become a daughter who doesn’t tarnish her mother’s name.” This led Park Gyuri to want to find success on her own, but thinking she made poor choices only made her feel guilty for potentially not living up to what her mom wanted from her.</p><br><p>Later, Park Gyuri revealed that all this had led her to develop a severe case of depression. Dr. Oh Eun Young bluntly asked her, “Do you think about wanting to die? Do you think about committing suicide?” Without hesitation, Park Gyuri replied, “Yes.” Instead of beating around the bush, Dr. Oh Eun Young explained that bluntly asking these questions was beneficial in helping people air their feelings out.</p><br><p><img alt=\"\" class=\"lazyload alignnone size-full wp-image-1532708\" src=\"https://0.soompi.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/24113302/Park-Gyuri-1.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://0.soompi.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/24113302/Park-Gyuri-1.jpeg 550w, https://0.soompi.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/24113302/Park-Gyuri-1-300x165.jpeg 300w, https://0.soompi.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/24113302/Park-Gyuri-1-540x297.jpeg 540w\" height=\"303\" sizes=\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\" width=\"550\"/></p><br><p>This led to Park Gyuri discussing her KARA bandmate Goo Hara, who <a href=\"https://www.soompi.com/article/1367711wpp/breaking-goo-hara-passes-away\" target=\"_blank\">passed away</a> in November 2019. Park Gyuri commented, “I’m not at all blaming her, but when Goo Hara passed away, for the first time, my values and thoughts wavered a lot and eventually crumbled. I never could’ve imagined that someone so beautiful, who received so much love, would choose to leave the world.” She added, “Since my fellow member left like that [by suicide], I also wonder whether it’s okay that I talk about her with regards to my own struggles.”</p><br><p>Dr. Oh Eun Young comforted Park Gyuri, saying, “A member you shared pain and joy with passed away. Those who remain inevitably feel apologetic for not treating them better. I can’t imagine how hard it was at your young age.”</p><br><p><img alt=\"\" class=\"lazyload alignnone size-full wp-image-1532706\" src=\"https://0.soompi.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/24113248/KARA1.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://0.soompi.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/24113248/KARA1.jpeg 650w, https://0.soompi.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/24113248/KARA1-300x166.jpeg 300w, https://0.soompi.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/24113248/KARA1-540x299.jpeg 540w\" height=\"360\" sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\" width=\"650\"/></p><br><p>Eventually, Dr. Oh Eun Young suggested that Park Gyuri try living more of a carefree life. She shared, “Gyuri, are you all done crying? Now, let’s walk boldly.”</p><br><p>Earlier this month, KARA got together for their <a href=\"https://www.soompi.com/article/1530513wpp/kara-reunites-for-15th-anniversary-shows-love-for-goo-hara\" target=\"_blank\">15th anniversary</a> and is currently in <a href=\"https://www.soompi.com/article/1530784wpp/kara-in-talks-to-reunite-for-15th-anniversary-project\" target=\"_blank\">discussions</a> to reunite for a special anniversary project.</p>\n",
